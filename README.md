# BowNet-Architecture
Codes for the BowNet and wBowNet models
BowNet and wBowNet are two new FCN (Fully Convolutional Networks) which use dilation convolutial layers as well as standard convolutional layers. Their performance and accuracy is better than or similar to the famous UNET architecture although their parameters are smaller significantly. 
Architectures of these two models can be seen below:
